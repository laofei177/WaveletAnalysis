# WaveletAnalysis

Wavelet anaysis tool by Torrence and Compo [1998] is very popular in climatology. However, Liu et al. [2007] has pointed out that the method by Torrence and Compo [1998] has a bias in favor of large scales.

This notebook is the translation of Liu et al.'s matlab test program

to python.
